# any

```
any(Expr, ..., Expr)
```

Any produces an event every time any of it's arguments produce an event.

```
any(42, load("/foo/bar"), load("/foo/baz"))
```

Will produce 42, and then all the updates to `/foo/bar` and `/foo/baz`
in whatever order they arrive.

```
mean(any(load("/bench/0/0"), load("/bench/0/1")))

```

Will produce the average of the values of `/bench/0/0` and
`/bench/0/1`.
